# Starlinker
Anonymized version of a Starlink API standardization tool, developed for the BC Government (CITZ).

Some key elements have been omitted or anonymized for network security reasons, so none of this will run. I also had to build some API wrappers, which are not included. If you're reading this, please excuse the mess!
